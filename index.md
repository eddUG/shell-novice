This workshop is an introduction to using unix shell. We can't cover every case 
or give an exhaustive course on familiarization on unix shell in a few sessions. 
Instead, this workshop is intended to give a basic introduction. Use of the shell 
is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks. These lessons will 
introduce you to this powerful tool

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Command line experience is necessary for this lesson. We recommend the
> participants to go through
> [shell-novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), if new to the
> command line (also known as terminal or shell).
> This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the shell.
> If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize the word “file”
> and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words for the same thing),
> you’re ready for this lesson.
