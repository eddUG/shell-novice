Welcome to the Shell novice lessons for vector research groups: a domain-adapted 
rewrite of the Software Carpentry Unix Shell lesson. This workshop is an introduction to 
using Unix Shell. We can't give an exhaustive course in a few sessions. Instead, we intend
to give a basic introduction. Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced 
computing tasks. These lessons will introduce you to this powerful tool.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the shell.
> If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize the word “file”
> and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words for the same thing),
> you’re ready for this lesson.

By the end of the workshop, learners will be able to:

* Navigate the filesystem and manage files/folders safely.
* Inspect and summarize text data using wildcards and quoting.
* Build simple data pipelines with pipes and redirection to filter/aggregate records.
* Automate repetitive work with loops and small shell scripts that accept arguments.
* Find files and content across a project and capture results to new files.
* Get help and troubleshoot.
* Record and organize work for reproducibility.
