Before touching variants, Mariam needs context: how many samples per species, population, country?

### Assignment
1. How can you build a **descending count table** of samples per **population** from `samples.tsv` (skipping the header)?
2. How will you build a **descending count table** of samples per **species**?
3. What pipeline will produce the list of **unique country–population pairs** as a two-column TSV?
4. How will you create a **sample→population map** (two columns) for joining later?
5. How can you extract the **VCF sample order** from the `#CHROM` header line as one sample ID **per line**?
