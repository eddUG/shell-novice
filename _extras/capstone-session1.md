Mariam refuses “mystery data.” She first verifies what she has, where it is and records this in a log.

**Assignment (answer with shell commands):**
1. How will you **create** the project subfolders (`results/`, `scripts/`, `logs/`) if they don’t exist?
2. How will you **start a day log** that includes the current date/time?
3. Which command(s) let you **list file sizes** in `data/` and **append** that listing to your log?
4. How can you **peek safely** at the first few lines of `samples.tsv` and **count** how many lines it has?
5. What’s a safe way to **count non-header records** in the compressed VCF?

> ### Deliverables
> - `logs/day1.log` with sizes, peeks, and counts you ran.
> - Confirmed folder structure.
