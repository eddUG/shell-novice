title: session 5 —  Automate, package and reflect 
---

One pipeline should reproduce everything.

**Assignment:**
1. What should the **preamble** of a robust shell script include to stop on errors and create needed folders?
2. In what **order** will you call your pipelines to regenerate every result from Days 2–4?
3. Where will you **tee** progress messages and **key counts** so they land in a single run log?
4. How will you **verify** that expected output files exist (and optionally how many lines they contain)?
5. What **three bullet points** would you write in a reflection about (a) what worked, (b) what felt limiting, (c) what you’d automate next?

> ### Deliverables
> - `scripts/run_all.sh` (executable)  
> - `logs/run_all.log`, `logs/reflection.md`  
> - All `results/` tables regenerated by the script
